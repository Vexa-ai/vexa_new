# Vexa: API for **Real-Time Meeting Transcription**

Vexa is an API for **real-time meeting transcription** using **meeting bots** and direct **streaming from web/mobile apps**. It extracts knowledge from various platforms including:

- **Google Meet**
- **Zoom**
- **Microsoft Teams**

Built with a **scalable architecture**, Vexa is designed to eventually support **thousands of simultaneous users** and **concurrent transcription sessions**. It aims to be an **enterprise-grade** alternative to [recall.ai](https://recall.ai) with numerous extra features, developed with **secure corporate environments** in mind where **data security** and **compliance** are crucial.

### Create a meeting bot

  }'
```

### Retrieve meeting transcript
```bash
# GET /transcripts/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}
# Example assumes native_meeting_id is derived from the meeting URL
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY" \
  https://gateway.dev.vexa.ai/transcripts/google_meet/xxx-xxxx-xxx
```

```json
